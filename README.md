# NO2 Time Series with Earth Engine
This code generates a time series chart of NO2 concentration over Kanpur, India using data from the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI instrument. The code is written in Google Earth Engine, a platform for analyzing and processing geospatial data.

## Usage
To use this code, you need to have a Google Earth Engine account and access to the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data. Once you have these, you can copy the code into a new script in the Earth Engine Code Editor and run it.

The code takes two variables representing the start and end dates for the time series. You can modify these variables to generate a time series for a different time period or location. The resulting chart shows the monthly average NO2 concentration over the specified time period.
